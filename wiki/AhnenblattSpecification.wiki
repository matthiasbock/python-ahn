#summary Ahnenblatt File Format Specification

= Dirk Böttcher's Ahnenblatt - File Format Specification =

_Dirk Böttcher's Ahnenblatt_ family tree software uses a proprietary file format to save it's genealogy data.

The file consists of a header with magic bytes and meta information, followed by a sequence of datasets, one dataset per person.


The length of a dataset depends on the amount of information stored.
A dataset is a sequence of fields. Each field starts with a one byte qualifier,
defining what kind of information follows, followed by a 2 byte little-endian word,
defining how many bytes of information follow.
The information itself is stored as standard ASCII string, terminated by: <0x00>
